# DALL-E 2

DALL·E 2 is an AI system that can create realistic images and art from a description in natural language.

DALL·E 2 can create original, realistic images and art from a text description. It can combine concepts, attributes, and styles.

In January 2021, OpenAI introduced DALL·E. One year later, our newest system, DALL·E 2, generates more realistic and accurate images with 4x greater resolution.

## Empower People to Express Themselves Creatively

Our hope is that DALL·E 2 will empower people to express themselves creatively. DALL·E 2 also helps us understand how advanced AI systems see and understand our world, which is critical to our mission of creating AI that benefits humanity.
